# Business Idea Generator

> Automatically generate business ideas

This is a silly proof of concept. You will need [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) to make it work. To run, [download this repository](https://github.com/RichardLitt/business-generator/archive/master.zip) and then run:

```sh
$ node index.js
```

It will print something like this:

```
17:19 ~/src/business-generator üêï  node index.js
Sell Bottle mementos at bars.

Or, like dropbox, but for irony
```

## Why did you build this

To prove that I could do it. It's better to make something than to say you can make something.

Specifically, I said this: "In a couple of minutes, I could code you a generator with dozens of different ideas."

I was off by a factor of 10. It took me 22 minutes, and counting, to make this.

## Contribute

Go ahead? I am unlikely to actively maintain this. It is not soundly built.
